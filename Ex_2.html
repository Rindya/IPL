<mt1> Narural Satellite</mt1> <br>
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet, with a diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia)
<br><br>

<mt1> Names and etymology</mt1><br>
The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply Moon, with a capital M.The noun moon is derived from Old English mōna, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic *mēnōn,which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *mēnsis "month" (from earlier *mēnōt, genitive *mēneses) which may be related to the verb "measure" (of time).
<br><br>

<mt1> Formation</mt1><br>
Isotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System.[35][36] Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed,[37] but none satisfactorily explains the features of the Earth–Moon system.
